# Rust Bootcamp Project Guide

Welcome to your 6-week Rust journey! This directory contains your learning scaffolding and project guidance. For the complete syllabus and detailed instructions, visit the [main bootcamp repository](https://github.com/paiml/ds500-rust-bootcamp).

## Project Overview

You'll be building a single, evolving project over 6 weeks that demonstrates mastery of Rust fundamentals and best practices. This project will grow from basic setup to a production-ready command-line application.

## Weekly Milestones

### Week 1: Development Environment Setup
- [ ] Fork the template repository
- [ ] Set up your development environment (VS Code, rust-analyzer, etc.)
- [ ] Initialize your project structure
- [ ] Get familiar with Cargo and basic Rust tooling

**Focus**: Environment setup, basic project structure, getting comfortable with Rust tooling

### Week 2: Project Structure and Planning
- [ ] Define your project concept and goals
- [ ] Design your project architecture
- [ ] Set up initial file structure and modules
- [ ] Create basic Cargo.toml configuration

**Focus**: Project planning, module organization, understanding Rust project conventions

### Week 3: Data Structures and Core Logic
- [ ] Implement core data structures (structs, enums)
- [ ] Handle ownership and borrowing in your data types
- [ ] Create foundational business logic
- [ ] Work with collections (Vec, HashMap, etc.)

**Focus**: Rust's type system, ownership model, data modeling for your domain

### Week 4: Libraries and Testing
- [ ] Organize code into reusable modules and libraries
- [ ] Write comprehensive unit tests
- [ ] Add integration tests
- [ ] Create documentation with examples
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline

**Focus**: Code organization, testing strategies, documentation, professional development practices

### Week 5: Command-Line Interface
- [ ] Implement CLI argument parsing
- [ ] Add proper error handling and user feedback
- [ ] Create help documentation and usage examples
- [ ] Polish the user experience
- [ ] Performance optimization

**Focus**: CLI best practices, error handling, user experience, performance

### Week 6: Final Polish and Presentation
- [ ] Code review and refactoring
- [ ] Final testing and bug fixes
- [ ] Complete documentation
- [ ] Prepare final presentation
- [ ] Deployment considerations

**Focus**: Code quality, presentation skills, reflection on learning journey

## Decision Points and Considerations

As you progress through each week, consider these architectural and design questions:

- **Data Design**: How will you model your problem domain? What structs and enums make sense?
- **Error Handling**: How will you handle different types of errors? Custom error types vs. standard library?
- **Performance**: Where are the performance bottlenecks? How can you optimize without sacrificing readability?
- **Testing**: What's your testing strategy? How will you test edge cases and error conditions?
- **CLI Design**: How will users interact with your application? What's the most intuitive interface?

## Resources and Support

- **Main Syllabus**: [github.com/paiml/ds500-rust-bootcamp](https://github.com/paiml/ds500-rust-bootcamp)
- **Rust Documentation**: [doc.rust-lang.org](https://doc.rust-lang.org/)
- **Weekly Videos**: Available in the Pragmatic AI Labs platform
- **Community Support**: Discord channel for bootcamp participants

## Weekly Reflection

Document your progress and learnings each week:

### Week 1 Reflection
- What challenges did you face setting up your environment?
- What debugger choice did you make and why?

### Week 2 Reflection
- What project idea did you choose and why?
- How did you approach the initial architecture design?

### Week 3 Reflection
- What data structures did you implement?
- What ownership/borrowing challenges did you encounter?

### Week 4 Reflection
- How did you organize your tests?
- What testing patterns worked best for your project?

### Week 5 Reflection
- What CLI design decisions did you make?
- How did you handle error cases and user feedback?

### Week 6 Reflection
- What are you most proud of in your final project?
- What would you do differently if you started over?
- What's your next step with Rust?

## Submission Guidelines

Your final project should include:
- [ ] Working Rust application with CLI interface
- [ ] Comprehensive test suite
- [ ] Clear documentation and README
- [ ] Demonstration video (3-5 minutes)
- [ ] Reflection on your learning journey

Remember: This project is your portfolio piece. Make it something you're proud to showcase!
